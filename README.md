# FEND Restaurant Review App

### Overview

For the Restaurant Reviews projects, I was tasked to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In Stage One, I had to take a static design that lacked accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I was also tasked to begin converting this to a Progressive Web Application by caching some assets for offline use.

### Specification

You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

### Steps to run application

* Fork and Clone repository.

* I had to use Google Maps for GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY.

* From inside the new directory, launch a local client server using Python from your terminal:
Python 2: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
Python 3: python3 -m http.server 8000

* Visit the site in your browser at http://localhost:8000
